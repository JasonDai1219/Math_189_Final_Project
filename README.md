# Math_189_Final_Project
In this project, we **loaded and managed data**, **fitted linear and logistic regression models**, **performed hypothesis testing**, **conducted ridge regression**, **implemented random forests**, and **applied cross-validation**. we also **split data into training and validation sets**, **computed performance metrics**, **performed PCA**, and **created visualizations and biplots**. Finally, we presented all my results and interpretations in a reproducible **RMarkdown** document.
